# PyInstaller GUI
---

## Last version
2020/02/11: v1.0.0 [[Download EXE file here]](https://triplec-light.000webhostapp.com/PyInstallerGUI/download.html)

## What is this?
Original pyinstaller has too much command, and if I have different files or import module on different path, the command will become very loooooooooong~, so I think maybe I can use GUI to solve my problem.

This application is coded by **Python** and web frameworks **Tornado**, so it will use Web to show control interface.

## Usage
1. If you use exe file, just double click PyInstallerGUI.exe
2. If you download source code to use, just open and run PyInstallerGUI.py
3. if your browser doesn't open automatically, you can open it by yourself and go to **http://localhost:8888**
4. You can see the GUI below now

5. You can change language on top selector
